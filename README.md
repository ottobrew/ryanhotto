My portfolio website featuring my software projects, technical experience, and programming languages.  Recently built with Javascript modules utilizing a Project, Job, Language, and Degree classes, ensuring scalability for additional objects.  Data for these objects is mapped from JSON files to an array of objects, then added to DOM.  
Built with HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON, and Bootstrap 5.
